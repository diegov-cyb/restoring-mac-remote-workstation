# restoring-mac-remote-workstation
Restored an older iMac through a clean macOS rebuild, USB installer recovery, system configuration. Repurposed the machine as a remote-access workstation and wireless extended display.

## **Project Overview**
The iMac originally could not boot properly and was stuck in outdated recovery utilities. I restored the machine by creating a property macOS installer, rebuilding the system fromUSB, configuring partitions, and reinstalling macOS. After the system was rebuilt, I configured it for modern usability. This included remote desktop, shared display functionality, and network-based management. This resulted in a fully revived iMac usable as:
- A standalone macOS workstation
- A remote machine accessible through screen sharing
- A wireless secondary display for productivity

## **Key Activities Completed**
- **System Recovery & OS Reinstallation**
    - Created a clean macOS installer using USB and Disk Utility
    - Rebuilt OS X Base System and restored macOS install media
    - Reformatted and re-partitioned the internal drive
    - Performed full macOS reinstall
    - Ensured proper boot sequence and installer recognition

- **Device Optimization & Configuration**
    - Reconfigured system preferences, network, and startup disk
    - Installed updates, drivers, and modern security patches
    - Cleaned up the UI, services, and login items for responsiveness

- **Remote Access & Display Repurposing**
    - Enabled macOS Screen Sharing for remote-control functionality
    - Connected iMac wirelessly as a second monitor
    - Tested latency, resolution, and responsiveness
    - Verified multi-device display workflow
